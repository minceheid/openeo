This is the place for globals. For consistency all globals should be prefixed with "eo_"
and any "private" globals that should not be exported through public means 
(e.g. Prometheus or Home Assistant exporters) should be prefixed with underscore.
Values don't *need* to be predeclared here, but probably important that we document the
critical ones.
